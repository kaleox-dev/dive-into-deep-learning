intro
- regression answers "how much/many" questions
- there is a lot more to estimation than minimizing least squared errors
- there is a lot more to supervised learning than regression
- this section will focus on classication problems ("which category?")

examples
- does this email belong to the spam folder or the inbox?
- doe sthis image depict a donkey, a dog, a cat, or a rooster?

4.1.1. classification
- each input is a 2 x 2 grayscale image, so x1, x2, x3, x4 pixel values
- is it a cat, chicken or dog?
- can organize the labels as {1, 2, 3}
- one-hot encoding (a vector with as many components as we have categories)
- (1, 0, 0) is cat, (0, 1, 0) is chicken, and (0, 0, 1) is dog

4.1.1.1. linear model
